Google's documentation is like an ocean. It's not easy to find a right one to start. This note contains only basic things that I've already worked with. Trying your own hand at Google's APIs will help you understand more.

::: warning
This note focuses on the **Server-side Web Apps** (and a little bit on the **JS Web Apps**) only.

## A simple A-Z JS App using OAuth2



## A simple A-Z Server-side App using OAuth2



## Refresh an access token using HTTP/REST

ðŸ‘‰ [Official tutorial](https://developers.google.com/identity/protocols/oauth2/web-server#offline).

Request an APIs need an *access token* <= access token expire in a period of time <= need *refresh token* (obtained on the 1st time user gives the acess to your app) <= ==We can generate a "new" access token from refresh token==.
