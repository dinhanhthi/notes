::: warning
These my personal notes and experiences with Switch. If you find something wrong or there are other things better, [feel free to comment](https://github.com/dinhanhthi/dinhanhthi.com/discussions).
:::

## Good to know

1. You cannot transfer data from one user to another user! However, you can transfer data between consoles, between consoles and server. Other words, the save is sticked to the user.
2. Should buy games with different accoutns in case you wanna sell them later.
3. Don't buy a big case (which used for both switch and dock), just buy the case for only the switch (and its small accessories). Whenever you go somewhere, don't bring with you the dock, just the switch with an adapter (which play the same role as the dock).

## Share your games with friends and share the money

1. Suppose you have account A containing all of your games.
2. Suppose your friend account is B.
3. You and your friend should add A on your consoles. **Your friend's console should be the primary console** for A and **yours is the secondary**.
4. ==You and your friend must play in different accounts==. You play on A and your friend play on B.

What both of you can:

1. Play the same game at the same time.
2. Saved data are sticked to your own accounts (yours is A, your friend's is B).
3. If both of you subscribe to the nintendo online service, you can play games with each other.

## Using mouse and keyboard with switch?

For playing FPS games, for example. Just using [PXN K5 Pro adapter](https://www.amazon.fr/gp/product/B08P5L24HZ). Note that, the experience of playing game in that way is not so good as imagine. Be careful before you buy this adapter! However, I've tried and it's really work well!

**Fact**: I returned the adapter and use a good controller instead (Mine is Xbox controller).

## Using switch without dock?

Just use Buy an adapter (USB-C to HDMI & USB-A & USB-C), I use [Y Team's](https://www.amazon.fr/gp/product/B07DPDMFGH).

**Be careful**: make sure the adapter you buy work with the switch !!!

## Connect Xbox / PS4 / PS5 controller with Switch?

1. Buy a adapter. I use [MAYFLASH Magic NS Wireless Bluetooth Controller](https://www.amazon.fr/gp/product/B079B5KHWQ).
2. (Actually, just follow the guide on the adapter)
3. Plug the adapter to the switch and change to "Switch mode" (red light).
4. Make sure the light on the adapter is flashing (pairing mode).
5. Turn the controller on and make it in the pairing mode too.
6. Wait.
7. That's it!

## Should buy a third-party Joy-con?

**DON'T**! Let's buy the Nintendo's ones ==because of the easy in pairing and the battery life!== I know it's expensive but it's worth!

## Connect bluetooth speaker while playing with many bluetooth controllers

Normally, switch doesn't allow us to connect it to bluetooth speaker when we are playing with multiple bluetooth controllers. Following below steps:

1. Buy a Bluetooth Transmitter Receiver (I use [EasyULT](https://www.amazon.fr/gp/product/B08FRHGV5G/)). It has a USB output and a 3.5 input.
2. Make sure bluetooth speaker is off.
3. Connect transmitter to the switch dock via USB (or other power source, just to keep it on).
4. Plug the audio cable to both switch and the transmitter. From now, switch thinks you are using a speaker with the 3.5 jack.
5. Change the transmitter to **TX mode** ("Transmit mode") so that the audio from switch can transmit to speaker via bluetooth.
6. Click the main button on the transmitter to turn to the "searching for bluetooth speaker" mode.
7. Turn the bluetooth speaker on (I use *JBL Flip 5*), put it in the pair mode.
8. Wait.
9. Make sure the bluetooth speaker is well connected with the transmitter.
10. That's it!
11. If you have done everything but the sound still doesn't appear, try to restart the speaker and reset the pearing mode.
